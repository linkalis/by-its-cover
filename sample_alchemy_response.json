  "text": "Nekima Levy-Pounds, a civil rights activist and critic of local police practices, will announce Tuesday that she is running for mayor of Minneapolis.\nLevy-Pounds, 40, an attorney who stepped down in October as president of the Minneapolis NAACP, said she’ll make her formal announcement at a news conference in front of the Minneapolis police Fourth Precinct on the anniversary of the fatal shooting of Jamar Clark. A white Minneapolis police officer shot Clark, a black man, in a scuffle Nov. 15, 2015. His death prompted protests and an 18-day encampment outside the precinct in north Minneapolis.\nMayor Betsy Hodges, who was elected to a first term in 2013, is seeking re-election and will make a formal announcement later this year. Other candidates are also expected to jump into the race. The election is in November 2017.\nLevy-Pounds moved to north Minneapolis is September 2015 from Brooklyn Park, but said she has been involved in Minneapolis issues for several years. She was part of the group that successfully sought the repeal of lurking and spitting ordinances in 2015.\n“I am running in order to bring a paradigm shift in the city of Minneapolis,” Levy-Pounds said. “Given the high rates of racial disparities that communities of color are experiencing, we can no longer afford business as usual.”\nShe had been a law professor at the University of Thomas for 13 years before resigning this year. She’s been a practicing attorney for 15 years, and describes herself as “a preacher and activist” who previously preached at First Covenant Church in Minneapolis on racial and social justice issues and now attends Zion Baptist Church in north Minneapolis.\nShe said she was running as a member of the DFL Party, but did not know whether she’d seek the party’s nomination. The DFL convention, where candidates seek endorsements, is in June.\nHennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman declined to charge the officers involved in Clark’s death, saying the deadly force was justified. Police Chief Janeé Harteau also found that the officers’ actions were warranted.\nThe day after Clark was killed, Levy-Pounds was one of dozens of people arrested during a protest on Interstate 94 in Minneapolis. She received a stay of adjudication with eight hours of community service.\nLevy-Pounds was also one of 11 people charged for organizing Black Lives Matter demonstrations at the Mall of America in December 2014. She was charged with eight misdemeanors but in 2015, a Hennepin District Judge dismissed all of them.\nShe said, however, she is not running as a protest, but as a candidate intent on winning. If elected, Levy-Pounds said, one focus would be job creation, attracting business and corporations to move into the city, particularly to areas with high unemployment rates.\n“I would work with community stakeholders to address the crisis in affordable housing for low income and middle income individuals,” she said. “Beyond that, we need an overhaul of our criminal justice system within the city of Minneapolis from policing to charging decisions that are made.”\nTwitter: @randyfurst\n",
